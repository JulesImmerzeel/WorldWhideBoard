# World Whide Board
World whide board is a real time whiteboard that uses webRTC to establish a peer to peer connection between all online users.
Everybody is allowed to draw whatever they want!
The application is build in vanilla JS with Django channels as the signaling server. The backend is only responsible for letting all peers know each others ip and then all data is send without the server as middleman.

Feel free to fork this repo if you'd like to.
